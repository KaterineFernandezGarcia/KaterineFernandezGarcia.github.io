## Overview

Data-driven decision making (DDDM) is the practice of basing decisions on the analysis of data rather than purely on intuition or observation.

## Key Frameworks

### The DIKW Pyramid

- **Data** — Raw facts and figures
- **Information** — Data processed into meaningful context
- **Knowledge** — Information combined with experience
- **Wisdom** — Knowledge applied with judgment

### Evidence-Based Practice

A systematic approach to decision making that integrates the best available evidence with practical expertise and stakeholder values.

## Open Questions

- How do we balance quantitative data with qualitative insights?
- What are the ethical considerations of algorithmic decision making?
- How can small teams adopt DDDM without extensive resources?
