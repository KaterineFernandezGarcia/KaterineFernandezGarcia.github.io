## Introduction

Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on how components of a system interrelate and work together over time within the context of larger systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Feedback loops** — Understanding how outputs of a system circle back as inputs
- **Emergence** — How complex behaviors arise from simple interactions
- **Interconnectedness** — Recognizing that everything is connected

## Why It Matters

When we understand systems thinking, we can make better decisions by seeing the bigger picture rather than just individual parts.

## Getting Started

1. Start by mapping out the system you want to understand
2. Identify the key relationships between components
3. Look for feedback loops and patterns
4. Consider unintended consequences of changes

This framework can be applied to everything from personal productivity to organizational design.
